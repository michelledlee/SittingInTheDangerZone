# Sitting in the Danger Zone - Escape over-sitting by walking for your life

## Application Objective  
Sitting at your desk all day causes all sorts of health issues...or does it? What if the real source of that neck pain is from being inactive for too long and allowing for a flock of hungry seagulls to lock in on you and dive-bomb you for food? Maybe that tingling in your feet from being on your butt is actually Jack Frost nipping at your toes? Well now you can fight back against your pain by walking away from the danger that lurks from under your seat! This app uses your phoneâ€™s motion sensor to notify you when you need to get up and walk. Everyone is the hero of their own story. Walk to victory, earn points, and level up for bragging rights.
